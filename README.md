# toshokan

おまえはもうライブラリいる。なに？！

## Quickstart

Toshokan consists of **honbako** (本箱) that is the frontend application that optionally interact with **mori** (森) which acts as the server.

To ensure Toshokan can be run standalone without any friction, **honbako** will store/read data in JSON format on disk although connecting to a **mori** server instance is highly recommended.

## Toshokan Doushite Desu Ka?

Reinventing the wheel is part of the human culture ([refer to my feeble attempt back in 2017!](https://github.com/hueyyeng/AssetsBrowser)).

Before code and logic duplication start to spiral out of control, Toshokan aims to be a flexible (and opinionated) assets library as seen with Unreal Engine Content Browser, Blender Asset Browser, Unity Project Browser etc.
